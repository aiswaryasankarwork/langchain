@Angela Bunner @Kelsey Frost @Brian Shen  i made a quick brain dump with the main ideas i have about timesheet.
please review and comment and  - or add other ideas you may have or that your prospects requested.

this list doesn't represent the MVP, the features will during scoping be divided in versions.

    @zach Here are my ideas about the Timesheet. I think there could be a good space for a collaboration viz and dashboard for that.

    Reply to ad-309944 on 2021-10-22T04:28:09.702Z

    @Didier Varlot  is tracked meaning "assigned hours" that week , ie from task assignments?

    this is nice to have, as folks can create an Admin/OH proejct to track time to, doesn't need to necssarily be special hard-code built into the TS moo

 What's missing here that's more common is need to be abe to enter/override timesheet on behalf someone on your team, your directs.

Approveals. as PM, or Line Mgr. and ability to delegate approval.

Ability to enter CF's on timesheet records, like Work Type, Utilization Category, Location (as this may be used for tax purposes).

Ability to then apply RATES from user profile, to the time enter, and calc fields on task (like cost, revenue, billing).

    Reply to ad-309944 on 2021-10-22T04:58:41.639Z

    cost rates should be assoc with USER Profile.  Revenue/Bill rates should be based on project rate card, typically by client.  Rates and financials shouldn't show on timecard entry/ review, but on the proejct/task pages, or reports.



    ---------------
    Reply to ad-309944 on 2021-10-22T11:58:41.550Z

    The rates shall be per user or per project ( we may charge different rates for different types of project)?
anyway the first implementation should be only one  rate, but should we need after to have more?

    @Brian Shen
  I prefer to answer to your comment here as the answer will be included in the history of the task
is history required for MVP?
I think that it is indeed required. without it the user will fill in his timesheet submit it and have no way to find back what happened with the submission. he would have to search for every individual time entry of the week he want to see.  it would be like throwing his timesheet to a black hole.
not sure this make sense here? Shouldn't this be a button they can click on home or on the specific task?
The idea was this is the command center of the time tracking of the user, so naturally we added the tracking widget here also. The main use would be to add quickly a manual entry if during his review the user sees that one entry is lacking.
It is also true that the timer is also accessible as floating tool on the bottom.

Is there any plan to change the floating tools in the near future ( like revamp of the tray) to know if we can count on this tool for the MVP?

Are overview and Time Entries needed for MVP?
We imagined Overview as a welcome screen including some reports.
For MVP, the user will find the 3 donut charts and an histogram of the progress of his week
The time entry page is in fact where all the work of the user is done.
We discovered that editing directly in the timesheet is a complicated process for anything more than deleting an entry.
Grouping and sorting tasks will be offered later for the MVP only chronological order is available.
The time sheet page is where the user can have an overview and a last big picture view before submitting, This is also the view where the manager will approve or reject.
The "under review" page is where the user get the feed back from what is being reviewed and where he can answer to the comments of his manager and make edition on time entries that are marked for clarification.

The work diary page in Time entry will not be included in the MVP and we may also de scope the calendar view from the MVP.

This leaves still a large MVP.

I will prepare a flow chart in the brief to explain the workflow of the MVP and this will allow me to challenge our choice and maybe find a way to descope something.

    @Didier Varlot you should de-scope anything that isn't absolutely necessary.

For example:
Overview as a welcome screen including some reports.
For MVP, the user will find the 3 donut charts and an histogram of the progress of his week

There may be others, but can do do another pass and be really strict on what is MVP vs not?

    Reply to 120240300001 on 2021-12-22T15:02:27.141Z

    done. MVP is now bare bone. Weekly timesheet in one view and approval in the same view ( with a little addition)
I even de-scoped the request for clarification as it implies some comments to manage the back and forth. It will come later.
I want to organize a stakeholder review immediately after new year to review the design that will have been done and determine what feature in which phase after the MVP.

Thanks for sharing @Didier Varlot. On the summary time breakdown widgets (screenshot included) is it possible to toggle between auto vs manual and billable vs non-billable? I would see more clients getting value in being able to report on billable vs non-billable time breakdown than on manual time-tracking vs auto-tracking percentages.

    Looks great so far @Didier Varlot .  When approvals happen, will we lock the timesheet from being edited again?
The Max hrs per day is nice to have IMO. I'd rather have "duplicate last week's timesheet"
where will you put the Unassigned time to? Is the Hrs/Day/Week so that you can drive that Unassigned row? Will this time (and costs) go to an Overhead/Admin project?
For adding tasks - we need to make it super easy to find tasks.
Can user create NEW tasks here too?
Can we create add'l CF"s on the time entry, ie not just billable/nonbillable, but maybe also Location, Work Type (utilization category), override bill rate?


Adding @Abraham (Abe) Castro  since he's got Batchmasters client, for any thoughts too.
Same with @Alexander Gorman from Clarizen context, and other top asks for clients from CZ days.

@Angela Bunner every time a time entry is approved or rejected it is locked.
time entries remain editable until approved or rejected .
I'd rather have "duplicate last week's timesheet"
I am not sure I understand the use case as the tasks must have at least one time entry to appear here.
where will you put the Unassigned time to?
at present the unassigned are simply time entries that have no task allocated, so they are stored as unassigned. could you elaborate what you would like to do with unassigned time entries. I will accommodate this in a subsequent phase.

For adding tasks - we need to make it super easy to find tasks.
Fully adhere to this. I was thinking using the same approach as in the command bar ( with recent list).
Please note that the user doesn't directly add a task to the list but he adds a time entry allocated to a task not already in the list and automatically the task is added to the list.

Can user create NEW tasks here too?
very good point, Will add to a subsequent phase.

Can we create add'l CF"s on the time entry, ie not just billable/nonbillable, but maybe also Location, Work Type (utilization category), override bill rate?
So customization of the time tracking modal? good idea, but also for a subsequent phase.

Once I get a little bit more of feedback, I would like a meeting with you to get your opinion on prioritizing the features that will come in the subsequent phases and also to prioritize these phases vs other features (like dependencies, or calendar 2-way sync.)

    Reply to 13231012 on 2022-01-13T15:05:53.086Z

    Here are a few questions that came up from customers while sharing this and @Didier Varlot's responses in-line:
If you want to track time to a task/project, do we require a user to be assigned to that task/project?  (this is how Mavenlink and Klient do it).
This will not be the case in ClickUp as you do not have to be assigned, you just need to have access
Will you be able to set the max number of hours/set working days for teams/groups of employees?  Or is it a global setting or just individual by individual?
We can create a default setting for users for the ClickApp
Anything more would not be a part of the MVP
If someone selects a manager to approve time and that manager is OOO, can another admin approve the time?
Not in the MVP, but soon after we will add "approval by role"

    @Didier Varlot are you okay if we add an MVP column so it is easy to visualize what is included in the MVP?

Also, do you want us to add some indicator of where we vote a feature or should we just have a call to align on the plan?

    Reply to 13231012 on 2022-01-20T16:26:53.719Z

    @Devin Stoker  When you didn't vote for one feature does it mean that
you think it doesn't worth being included
that you don't have an opinion about which version it should be included in, or
You don't have any requests from customers about it
Only to understand how I should treat those lines with no votes.

Sorry for my late reply but here is my feedback:
Instead of naming it + Time Entry can we make it more descriptive and change it to something like: + Track Time to an existing task
Little user experiences like this would help the user better understand what is being asked of them, or how they can go about time tracking
I agree with @Angela Bunner Can users create NEW tasks here too?
How are approvers selected?
I saw the drop down, but would like to know if there is a particular role that we need to be included in that list.
Sometimes, approvers are not people managers, but project managers so flexibility would be nice to have here
Can you approve your own time entry?
This should not be the case for most orgs but want to ask
Notifications?
How do people know if time sheets have been approved? Changed back to In review?
Once something is approved, can we lock it?

@Mykyta Istomin  what do you think about this?

I agree with @Angela Bunner Can users create NEW tasks here too?
This is something we can allow in the task field of the modal of tracking time.

How are approvers selected?
for the MVP the approver will be a simple people field where the user can put whoever he wants so can be a project manager or a team manager. There will be no restriction at that stage. so complete flexibility

Can you approve your own time entry?
the fact that the choice of who will approve is totally open, but we may prevent this in any case

Notifications?
There will be notifications for timesheet submitted, approval requested, timesheet approved
Furthermore in the scrolling list of weekly timesheet a dot indicate the status of the timesheet

Once something is approved, can we lock it?
Once the timesheet has been fully, or partally approved or rejected it is locked

@Angela Bunner @Devin Stoker @Abraham (Abe) Castro @Alexander Gorman

With the focus that we are required to give to bug resolution, performance improvement, and quick UX wins, we had to review the priority of each new feature.
In parallel, the squad should receive soon additional resources, which will help mitigate the impact.
The best estimate that I can give now is that:
the development shall begin during Q1 FY2023 ( mid-march or April)
the release of the MVP shall happen at the beginning of Q2 FY2023.
Timesheet shall be the first new Epic that we will start.
We will use this time to refine the approval and notification design.
I will keep you posted with any updates that will come to my knowledge.

I suggest we put this delay into profit by developing a more scalable approval approach.
What is your opinion on the following points:
what other objects (out of timesheet) would benefit at some stage from approval?
Task status change?
Documents?
Other?
Should we offer a centralized place for all approvals, or should approvals be distributed in every object benefiting from approvals?

    @Didier Varlot all kinds of work can benefit from an approval if we go the route of building an engine for it.  Here are a couple more to add to the list on top of timesheets and docs:

Project requests for PMOs and initial setup of project framework (time and budget)
Work concessions
Change requests to scope, budget, or time
Vacation requests

@Devin Stoker I can only guarantee that we will get it out as quick as possible ( at least the MVP - as we have to discuss how the subsequent phases are prioritized compared with the calendar sync and other features). But I cannot set a target date now. Fortunately, I will receive additional resources soon and this may make me more optimistic when they will join the squad, but for the moment all depends on how we put the bugs under control with the limited resources available.
I will keep you posted on a regular basis about this.



    ---------------
    Reply to 13234044 on 2022-01-25T15:24:25.327Z

    @Devin Stoker we cannot guarantee a late march delivery. At this point all we can say is later this year since the primary focus is reliability and performance. Basically 100% of resources outside of Whiteboards are focusing on the refactoring so we can get out of the woods.

The squad that is tackling timesheets is one of the most understaffed areas, but also one of the areas with the most bugs.



    ---------------
    Reply to 13234044 on 2022-01-25T21:20:56.884Z

    I would recommend that the approval engine be built independently of this functionality (I know, easy for me to say).

The reason is due to how customers may want to use it. I can already see approval functionality extending beyond timesheets. I would rather that be an object/feature that customers can use in an interoperable manner with other objects such as lists, tasks, comments, docs, timesheets, automation, templates, etc.

In my opinion (if you're interested), it is better to build for scalability before we introduce a feature so that it doesn't limit workflow configurations and use cases later.

    @Devin Stoker no we don't have an updated timeline at this time. It's wholly dependent on getting out of the woods with bugs.

I have also been pushing for a more scalable approach to approvals. It should be able to be generalized for other object types as well.

    @Angela (OOO until 2/28) We will start in Q1 but may release only in Q2, depending on resources.
I included in the scope:
weekly timesheet ( as per the design already presented)
possibility to modify tracked time and to track time from the timesheet page
automatic submission of timesheet to a manager ( set in the timesheet page menu)
Access to history of timesheets
Approval of individual timesheets by a manager
History of approvals
The design of the approval page still needs some work (adding comment capacity), but due to the events in Ukraine, I have no design capacity.

    That's still a lot to cover. I'd prioritize Weekly Timesheet & Approval first - then history/audit.
How do you differentiate  "History of approvals" vs. "History of Timesheets"? You mean Past timesheets? I'd expect History of Timesheets to include the approvals of those timesheets. @Didier Varlot

PM Update
The design of the timesheet is completed, The task is being split for validation between timesheet and approvals as approval design is lagging.
The abrupt modification of squad capacity obliges us to re-prioritize this feature vs the Summary Tasks, the Logic in forms and the Calendar sync.

If we want to do a brainstorm on how we could get a faster version of Timesheets out, I can set up for when I'm back from PTO.

Currently not on the ICP list and resources are needed for 3.0. But a brainstorm could be interesting for an hour. Let me know!

there is still room for improvement, for example, we can use the already designed right sidebar pattern for history, comments and export.

@Anthony Creek can I get a quick update on this? A client we're meeting next week will really want to learn more about what our plans are if they have changed, and if we have more details on how it will work. Would you be able to record a loom for me and also share any slides and figma files we might be able to use?

Our backend developer is scheduled to join us on July 10 currently. We will try to do what we can before then, but hard to say how much progress can be made until he is with us full-time.

    @Anthony Creek I remember at one point we talked about defaults for billable vs. not-billable. I didn't see that in your brief and this is one of the requirements for the customer (watch this chorus video https://hello.chorus.ai/listen?guid=3e930cdeb9a4460a90b9543806c13b55)

    @Briana Ings This is really a bit of stand-alone functionality so I don't have it included in the timesheets project. I'm starting to make a list of these and put some initial thoughts together. I'll add the Chorus video to my doc as well.

    Yes, not a problem. I wasn't sure what the process was to go from an idea/need to a roadmap item so I thought I'd just start collecting them and go from there. I'll move that over though.

Comment ID 98020014599847 on 2023-07-14T13:26:04.569Z

@Anthony Creek, I anticipate this to be heavily impacted by our lack of ability to display numbers in localized formats.
I've described the issue here: , and while date formatting is a smaller issue, number formatting has been brought up in localization feedback from users, and will impact the usability of the solution significantly for users in non-English markets.
I understand if this is not a priority, but wanted to make sure you are aware of this and how it might potentially impact adoption.

    Reply to 98020014599847 on 2023-07-14T16:35:50.971Z

    Can you clarify the issue here? We are using HH:MM time format, which I don't see called out as problematic in your doc. It's the same format used in the time tracking component, which is why we've carried it through to the timesheet.

For dates, we are using  a format like Jul 14, 2023.

We'd definitely like to add support for a time format preference to allow the user to choose and have a consistent experience throughout the app since right now it varies by component. But that won't be part of this project.

    @Hemant Kumar @Brian Shen how do squads currently rollout feature betas, and how do you think we can improve the process?



    ---------------
    Reply to 98020014721306 on 2023-08-22T01:08:06.253Z

    hey @Nick Paranomos -

What i do currently: For each feature that goes through beta, i send out a canny post and reach out to Angela's team to get a list of workspaces that need early beta access. And once we roll out the beta to these workspaces, i create a feedback loop (through form) and then take a  go/no-go decision to GA. This works quite well for my squad so far since all features we built have high customer interest and we get lot of feedback related to the feature.

A scalable way is having a set of workspaces ready for Beta at a CU level and squads enabling these workspaces for Beta. In addition, each squad can have their own beta list of customers or reach out users through canny and Angela's team



    ---------------
    Reply to 98020014721306 on 2023-08-22T20:49:24.480Z

    @Nick Paranomos every squad handles betas slightly differently, which makes it more challenging for GTM teams to become aware of the betas and get their customers signed up. And then once the betas are running, there isn't a single way that PMs go and collect the feedback, which also leads to challenges with where GTM teams can report feedback -- is it a slack channel, a form, a private canny board?

I would recommend standardizing across squads, especially how to request getting access to a beta and/or showing which betas are currently active.



    ---------------
    Reply to 98020014721306 on 2023-08-22T23:56:10.045Z

    @Haris Butt that's the plan. I'm going to start a project to ask you and other EPD leaders how we actually want to build (in detail, including beta releases). Then we'll document it in the operating manual, and update the roadmap space to match the build process we're targeting.
